made from [a tool that generates UML from existing code](http://staruml.io/).


Here is our amazing UI:

## Overview


## User Interface


## Configuration File Format
Example Fire XML File
```xml=
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Simulation simulation="FireExample">
	<title>Fire Example</title>
	<desciption>Example simulation of spreading fire</desciption>
	<author>Shaw</author>
	<rows>50</rows>
	<cols>50</cols>
	<probCatch>.25</probCatch>
</Simulation>
```
Exmaple WaTor XML File
```xml=
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Simulation simulation="WaTor Example">
    <title>WaTor Example</title>
    <description>Example WaTor Simulation</description>
    <rows>30</rows>
    <cols>30></cols>
    <fishRate>1</fishRate>
    <sharkRate>20</sharkRate>
    <sharkStarve>15</sharkStarve>
</Simulation>
